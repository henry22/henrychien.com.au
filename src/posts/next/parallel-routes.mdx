Parallel Routes are a powerful feature in Next JS, they allow you to simultaneously or conditionally render multiple pages in the same layout view.
This is useful for complex interfaces where you would need highly dynamic sections in the same layout.

An example could be a dashboard, where you want to display some dynamic pages,
in this scenario you might want to display some analytics, and some team activity / settings side by side.

In the diagram above, the purple section would be the analytics page, whilst the blue section is the
team page.

Notice how I said `page`, this is becuase a parallel route does infact build a new page, in the diagram you can see
in the top left, the break down of what the folder and file structure is.

A parallel route is defined by adding an `@` symbol in front of the folder name, this tells Next JS
that this is a parallel route.

The differnce here is, instead of just navigating to this page, we actually define the parallel route in
the layout file like this:

```tsx
export default function DashboardLayout({
  children,
  analytics, // [!code highlight]
  team, // [!code highlight]
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  analytics: React.ReactNode // [!code highlight]
  team: React.ReactNode // [!code highlight]
}) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      <div className="col-span-2">{children}</div>
      <aside className="space-y-4">
        {analytics} // [!code highlight]
        {team} // [!code highlight]
      </aside>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You can see the highlighted lines above, these are the parallel routes, we pass them in as props that are
a type of `reactNode`, This code will actually now render the pages within the layout, and you can still
create other children here and they will also be rendered.

This funny looking syntax is called a `slot`, and it is a way of passing in dynamic content to the layout.

### Default Fallback

Parallel routes also support a default fallback, this is a way of handling the case where a parallel route
is not found. Next JS will then automatically render the fallback component.

Create `default.tsx` for unmatched routes:

```tsx
export default function DefaultAnalytics() {
  return <div>Select an analytics view</div>
}
```

<Alert type="warning">
  Always include default.tsx files for slots that might not have matching routes,
If you do not include a `default.tsx` file, and the route is not found, Next JS will throw a
page breaking error.

</Alert>

### Conditional Rendering

We can also conditionally render slots, a good use case for this would be in an app where
you have users and admins, and maybe you have a dashbaord where for a user you only want to show
one slot, but an admin view might have two slots.

In the example below, you can see the highlighted line, this is the conditional function
that is checking if the user is an admin, if they are, then we render the anaalytics else we don't.

```tsx
export default function DashboardLayout({
  analytics,
  team,
}: {
  analytics: React.ReactNode
  team: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const { user } = useAuth()

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      <main>{/* Main content */}</main>
      <aside>
        {user.isAdmin && analytics} // [!code highlight]
        {team}
      </aside>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Parallel Routes with Modals

Parallel routes can also be used in conjunction with intercepting Routes to create modals that can support
deep linking.

This means that you can:

- Create a modal that is sharable through a URL
- This modal will preserve its context when the page is refreshed
- Allows you to close the modal using backwards navigation rather then going to the previous route.
- Reopening the modal from forward navigation

When you open a modal using this method, the modal will have it's own route, allowing you to share the link
to others whilst the modal maintains it's context and state.

### Loading States

Parallel routes also support loading states, you can create these by using a `loading.tsx` file and placing
it in the parallel route folder.

This will allow you to create a loading screen whilst the route is loading.

## Best Practices

- Use clear slot names (`@analytics` vs `@chart`)
- Keep parallel routes independent
- Use TypeScript for slot props
- Implement loading states per slot
- Handle errors at slot level
- Prefer client-side navigation between slots

You can play around with parallel routes in my Next JS workshop, which is a course that I created
to help you learn Next JS today, you can find it here:
